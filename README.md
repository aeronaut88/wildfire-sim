# Wildfire

A forest fire cellular automaton in a single HTML file. Pixel-art terrain, probabilistic
spread, wind, and missile strikes. Zero dependencies, zero build step.

Open `index.html` in any browser, or host it on GitHub Pages.

## How it works

The map is an N x N grid. Each cell is water, rock, grass, a small pine, or a large oak.
Terrain comes from layered value noise (elevation picks water and rock, moisture clusters
the trees into forests) plus one meandering river.

Every tick, each burning cell tries to ignite each neighbor:

```
P(ignite) = spread probability x fuel factor x wind factor
```

| Fuel  | Ignition factor | Burn duration (ticks) |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Grass | 1.00            | 2 to 4                |
| Pine  | 0.75            | 6 to 10               |
| Oak   | 0.55            | 12 to 20              |

Water and rock never burn. Burnt cells leave ash (grass) or a charred stump (trees), with
embers that glow for a few ticks.

Wind scales the probability by direction: up to 2.2x downwind, down to 0.1x upwind at full
strength. Diagonal neighbors (Moore mode) get a 0.65x penalty for distance.

## Controls

| Action              | Mouse / button      | Key     |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------|
| Fire a missile      | click the map       | `M` (random target) |
| Lightning strike    | right-click the map | `L` (random target) |
| Pause / resume      | Pause button        | `space` |
| Single step         | Step button         | `.`     |
| New random forest   | New Forest button   | `N`     |

Sliders: speed (ticks per second), blast radius, spread probability, wind strength,
map size (30 to 300), and tree density. Changing size or density regenerates the map.

## Host it on GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository and push this folder to it.
2. In the repo, open **Settings > Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, pick **Deploy from a branch**, choose `main` and `/ (root)`.
4. The site appears at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` within a minute or two.

The `.nojekyll` file keeps GitHub from running the page through Jekyll.

## Things to try

- Drop spread probability to around 0.2 and watch the fire fizzle. Nudge it up a hair and
  it percolates across the whole map. That threshold is the classic result from the
  original assignment.
- Point the wind east at full strength and strike the west edge.
- Set map size to 300 and blast radius to 6.
